1. Creating a new project:
    File -> New -> Project -> (SDK configured) Next -> check "create project from template" -> Next -> name your project / package -> Finish

2. Project Structure
    src
    packages
    classes

3. Short Cuts:
    rename = Shift + F6
    comment out code = Cmd + Shift + 7
    reformat code = Cmd + Alt + l
    duplicate line = Cmd + d
    create variable = Cmd + Alt + v
    import class = Alt + Enter
    generate code = Alt + Insert
    sout + Tab
    main + Tab

4.  Classes
    class name
    main method - runnable class
    variables -> declare & initialize
    System.out.println
    Hello World!
    methods

5. Git
    in-built terminal
    connect to your GitHub account
        VCS -> enable VCS -> select Git -> sign in
        File -> Settings -> Version control -> add account -> sing in
    clone a project
    zip a project ( + open project)
    create a branch
    fetch, update, pull, commit(!), push

6. IntelliJ
    Integrated Development Environment
    helps by doing things in the background (creates project structure)
    helps us to find mistakes
    comments /*, //, TODO, FIXME
    color coding (e.g. unused code)
    expand all / find file / collapse all

7. Debugging
    bug
    breakpoints
    helps to find errors but also to follow the code
